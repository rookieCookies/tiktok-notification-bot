# tiktok-notification-bot
A open-source auto-setup TikTok notification bot!

Since there are no open-source tiktok notification bots for discord I decided to make one myself! There is 1 bot that exists but it uses it as a premium feature which it really shouldn't be!

How to use:
  Its auto-setup so you will have to run it and configure the config file, and run it again
  
  Download Node.js preferably LTS version from here >> https://nodejs.org/en/
  After you do that open terminal on macOS or command prompt on windows
  Type "cd filelocation" and go to the location of the file
  Now type "node index.js" and it should generate the config file for you!
  Edit the config file to however you want it to be
  Now run "node index.js" again and the bot is ready and running, enjoy ^^
